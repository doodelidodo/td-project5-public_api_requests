# Treehouse Techdegree Project 5: Public API Requets

The task was to load 12 users via https://randomuser.me API and generate UserCards from them.
If you click on a user, further information is displayed in a modal. In the modal you can switch the users 
with the back and forth buttons. The search field let you search for a specific user. 

Going for "exceeds" rating

**Specific adjustments:**
- The search is performed immediately upon each entry. Thus, no button is needed to start the search.
- For the search: no result message added
- The navigation in the modal works during a search in such a way that you can only switch between the found users.
- If you click out of the modal, it gets also closed.
- no navigation buttons, if there is only one user showing.

**CSS Adjustments:**
- card: boxshadow, no radius, hover color
- modal: boxshadow, no radius, btn container no margin, btn new style 
- no search result: added as css style

**Technologies:**
- Javascript
- jQuery
- HTML & CSS
